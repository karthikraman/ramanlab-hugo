title: BT 3240 - Metabolic Regulation

**How is the complex process of metabolism controlled?** **How do organisms regulate gene expression, metabolite** **concentrations and metabolite fluxes?** **How can we systematically quantify these effects?** **How can we manipulate microbes towards desired engineering goals?**
