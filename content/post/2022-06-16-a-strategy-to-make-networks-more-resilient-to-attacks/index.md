title: A Strategy To Make Networks More Resilient To Attacks

---
**_by Aditi Jain_**

>   
“A variety of technological networks form the backbone of modern world infrastructure, and it is very essential to build safeguards to protect these networks against both failures and targeted attacks,” says **[Dr Karthik Raman](https://rbcdsai.iitm.ac.in/people/karthik-raman/)**, Associate Professor at the Bhupat & Jyoti Mehta School of Biosciences and a core member of the Robert Bosch Centre for Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (RBCDSAI), IIT Madras.  
Dr Karthik Raman and his student Mr. Sai Saranga Das worked on this problem and have come up with a strategy that makes the networks more resilient to adverse attacks. The strategy basically suggests a way of judiciously re-wiring a given network to reduce the risk of network failure due to any adverse attack. The research work has been published in an esteemed research journal Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications.
