In July 2011, our lab was chosen as a CUDA Research Centre (CRC) by nVidia. nVidia was also generous to donate a [Tesla C2070](http://www.nvidia.com/object/personal-supercomputing.html) graphics processing unit for our research on metabolic networks. [nVidia's website](http://research.nvidia.com/content/iitmadras-crc-summary "IIT Madras CUDA Research Summary") also has our CRC research summary.
