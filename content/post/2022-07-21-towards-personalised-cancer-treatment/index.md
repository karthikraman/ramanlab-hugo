title: Towards Personalised Cancer Treatment

---
**_by Aditi Jain_**

> Although, there does exist tools that identify personalized cancer genes, however, they use unsupervised learning method and predicts based on the presence and absence of mutations in cancer-related genes. This study, however, is the first one to use the supervised learning method by applying gene-based labelling that is cancer-specific. This new model also takes into account the functional impact of the mutations while making predictions.

> “ _The research area of precision medicine is still at a nascent stage. PIVOT helps push these boundaries and presents prospects for experimental research based on the genes identified_,” says Malvika Sudhakar, lead author of the study.
