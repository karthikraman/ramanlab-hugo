**_by Gayathri Sambamoorthy (and Karthik Raman)_**

Yamini, a class V
student, is a very playful child who keenly observes everything around her and comes
up with multiple questions that intrigued her. One morning she was angry with
her mother that she did not permit her to play in the sand. Seeing the energetic
kid unhappy, the teacher took the time to ask her about it.

After Yamini narrated, the
teacher decided to explain, " _Your mother is right! You may fall sick_
_because of the microbes or microorganisms present._" Yamini, confused
and curious, said, "I don't see anything in the sand. How will I fall
sick?" The teacher explained, "Microorganisms are small creatures
that exist everywhere, and we cannot see them. We can see them only through a
microscope!". She explains and adds further, "There are both harmful
and harmless microorganisms." "What do they eat? They are so
tiny!" exclaimed Yamini!

To quench her curiosity, the teacher decided to take her to
Class IX, where I was on a visit to explain my research. And I started my
research story from there:

"Microbes live everywhere.
Microbes feed on the nutrients available to them, like how humans eat to obtain
energy for survival. Now, how are these nutrients converted into energy? I am
sure all of you have heard about metabolism, which is the breakdown of complex
nutrients into simpler ones for the generation of energy. Similarly, every
microorganism in the universe exhibits metabolism for converting the available
nutrients into energy. Do we all eat the same food at our houses? No, right?
Then how do we all get the energy from different food sources? Although there
are differences in the food we take in, all of them are converted to energy. In
a similar fashion, there are several nutrients that the microorganisms can take
in, depending on the environment that they are present in."

I asked the students, "How
do you go from school to house?" They all replied differently: one
answered "cycle", another, "walk", and yet another, "bus",
etc. Yamini remained silent to understand my question and quickly replied, "I
go by auto." I smiled, "Good. Just like there is a route to reach
your house from the school, there is a path from the nutrients to reach the
energy molecules. This path is called a metabolic pathway". Then I asked
them, "If you start from different places such as market, railway station,
school, etc., to reach your house, will you go through the same routes?"
The students nodded to my rhetoric.

"Similarly, metabolic pathways
differ when different nutrients are converted to energy. Similar to different
stops from school to your house, there are analogous stops in these pathways, called
reactions. And the set of all these reactions in an organism is called a
metabolic network, basically, a network of reactions that are involved in
metabolism. These stops are different for different routes, and so are
reactions in different pathways. So, to put it together now, microbes ingest
various nutrients depending upon the environment they live in and through
different metabolic pathways based on the nutrient, they gain energy. These
pathways are composed of many reactions that are different for different
pathways. Now the tricky question. Is there only one route to your house from
school". Pat came the reply, "No", in chorus.

I continued, "There are different routes by which energy can be obtained from the same nutrient, similar to the different routes you have to reach your house from school. These are called alternating pathways since you go through one of the paths at a time. A reaction pair, one from each alternating pathway, is termed synthetic lethal, analogous to two bus stops from different routes. Say, for example, what happens if one of the routes to your home is blocked? You have another route, right? So, if one reaction of the synthetic lethal pair is absent, energy can still be produced for growth via the other reaction. Further, when an organism is present in an environment for a long time, they tend to evolve. Just like any other living being!"
