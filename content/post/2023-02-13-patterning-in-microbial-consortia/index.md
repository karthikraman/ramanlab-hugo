title: Patterning in Microbial Consortia

---
> Scientists are studying this spatial organization of microbial communities to understand the relationships between different microbes better and their functions in that particular environment. For example: in the human gut, various parameters such as pH, oxygen concentration or substrates keep varying and different bacterial families reside in a location where the parameters are most conducive for their growth. Understanding why particular bacteria prefer a particular location helps in ascertaining their function in the community and that environment better. Such knowledge also helps in devising novel biotechnological solutions such as biosensors or biofilms with desired properties based on spatial organization parameters like location and strength of coupling among different species.
