title: Discovering Cellular Networks for Biological Adaptation

---
**_by Akshay Anantharaman_**

> In this study, the authors of this paper —Mr. Priyan Bhattacharya and Prof. Arun K. Tangirala from the Department of Chemical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai, India, and Dr. Karthik Raman from the Department of Biotechnology, Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai, India—have for the first time suggested a generic systems-theoretic approach to unravel the possible networks design configurations for perfect adaptation.  The proposed approach translates the conditions for biological adaptation into precise mathematical equations using systems theory. Further, these equations are mapped back to necessary structural requirements with the help of combinatorial mathematics.
