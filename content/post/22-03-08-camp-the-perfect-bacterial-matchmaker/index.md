title: 'CAMP: The Perfect Bacterial Matchmaker'

**_by Aditi Jain_**

> **[Dr Karthik Raman](https://rbcdsai.iitm.ac.in/people/karthik-raman/)**, an Associate Professor at IIT Madras and a core member of RBCDSAI, is a scientist whose interest lies in discerning the dynamics of microbial interactions to utilize them for biotechnological application. Recently, Dr Raman and a post-doctoral fellow in his group, Dr Maziya Ibrahim proposed a computational approach named CAMP(Co-culture/Community Analyses for Metabolite Production) which suggests how to bundle two or more bacteria together, forming a community that produces the desired products in maximum quantity. Given the significance of the work, it has been published in a prestigious international _Computational and Structural Biotechnology Journal._

> “ To understand compatibility and interactions based on growth between the members of a microbial community, we have introduced a computational analysis framework that evaluates all possible two-species communities generated from a given set of microbial species on single or multiple substrates to achieve optimal production of a target metabolite,” says Dr Raman.
