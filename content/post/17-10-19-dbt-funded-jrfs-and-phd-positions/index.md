**_Open Position_**

Applications are invited for a **Junior Research Fellow (JRF)** position in a project funded by the Department of Biotechnology at the **Computational Systems Biology Lab ( [/kraman/lab/](/kraman/lab/))**, IIT Madras.

**_PhD applications are also welcome_**: apply at [https://research.iitm.ac.in/](https://research.iitm.ac.in/) to one of the following departments:

- Interdisciplinary Stream on “Data Science and Artificial Intelligence” ( [https://sites.google.com/a/smail.iitm.ac.in/iitm-idrp/home](https://sites.google.com/a/smail.iitm.ac.in/iitm-idrp/home))
- Biotechnology Department
- Chemical Engineering
- Computer Science

**_Project_**

The burgeoning amounts of cancer genome data have opened several avenues for computational analysis of these sequences to gain insights into disease associations of genes, as well as the molecular bases of diseases. While many recent studies have proposed approaches to identify driver and passenger mutations in cancer genes, the studies have not examined the context of these mutations in detail, which might have significant influence on the effect of the mutations and the subsequent progression of cancer. In this study, we seek to apply a combination of statistical and machine learning techniques to analyse novel genomic data generated from [Cambridge](https://www.mrc-cu.cam.ac.uk/), as well as sequence data available in the public domain, to build a computational pipeline for the identification of the context of cancer mutations in genome sequences.

**_Qualifications_**

BE/BTech/MTech in any branch of engineering, with a GPA of 7.5 and above. Programming experience in at least one high-level programming language (e.g. Python) is mandatory. Some exposure to biological data analysis will be helpful; Familiarity with NGS data analysis pipelines / RNASeq will be a major plus.

Interested candidates can send their CV by e-mail with subject line “\[DBT JRF\]” to:
