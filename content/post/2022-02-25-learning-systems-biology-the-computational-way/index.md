title: Learning Systems Biology, the Computational Way!

Dr Raman felt the need to write this book when he realized that none of the existing books gave a balanced treatment to the three major modelling approaches—static network biology, dynamic modelling and constraint-based modelling—which he thinks is central to build a holistic view of various kinds of biological networks. The book is apt for students who are curious about the working of a biological system, are mathematically inclined and knows a high-level computing language. The book takes a practical and a fun hands-on approach to teach modelling approaches. Apart from in-depth chapters, the book provides information about the additional material available on the internet for the students who are more interested in a particular topic. Abreast with current times, the book has chapters on community modelling and biological circuit design which are new fields of study. The book also has a companion website replete with lecture videos, supplementary exercises, and a host of reading material. The book is a must for students and researchers who need means to satiate their curiosity about biological systems.
