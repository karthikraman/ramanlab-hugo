**Background**

Recent studies have provided
insights into the persistence and succession of microbes aboard the
International Space Station (ISS), notably the dominance of _Klebsiella pneumoniae_. However, the
interactions between the various microbes aboard the ISS, and how it shapes the
microbiome remain to be clearly understood. In this study, we apply a
computational approach to predict possible metabolic interactions in the ISS
microbiome and shed further light on its organization.

**Results**

Through a combination of a systems-based
graph-theoretical approach, and a constraint-based community metabolic modelling
approach, we demonstrated several key interactions in the ISS microbiome. These
complementary approaches provided insights into the metabolic interactions and
dependencies present amongst various microbes in a community, highlighting key
interactions and keystone species. Our results showed that the presence of _K. pneumoniae_ is beneficial to many
other microorganisms it coexists with, notably those from the _Pantoea_ genus. Species belonging to the _Enterobacteriaceae_ family were often found to be the most beneficial for
the survival of other microorganisms in the ISS microbiome. However, _K. pneumoniae_ was found to exhibit parasitic and amensalistic interactions
with _Aspergillus_ and _Penicillium_ species, respectively. To
prove this metabolic prediction, _K._
_pneumoniae_ and _Aspergillus fumigatus_ were
co-cultured under normal and simulated microgravity, where _K. pneumoniae_ cells showed parasitic characteristics to the fungus.
The electron micrography revealed that the presence of _K. pneumoniae_ compromised the morphology of fungal
conidia and degenerated its
biofilm-forming structures.

**Conclusion**

Our study underscores the importance of _K. pneumoniae_ in the ISS, and its potential positive and negative interactions with other microbes, including potential pathogens. This integrated modelling approach, combined with experiments, demonstrates potential for understanding the organization of other such microbiomes, unravelling key organisms and their interdependencies.
