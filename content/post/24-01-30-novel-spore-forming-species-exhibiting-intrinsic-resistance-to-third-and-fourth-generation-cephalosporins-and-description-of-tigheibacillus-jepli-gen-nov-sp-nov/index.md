title: Novel spore-forming species exhibiting intrinsic resistance to third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins and description of Tigheibacillus jepli gen. nov., sp. nov.

---
A comprehensive microbial surveillance was conducted at NASA’s Mars 2020 spacecraft assembly facility (SAF), where whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of 110 bacterial strains was performed. One isolate, designated 179-BFC-A-HST, exhibited less than 80% average nucleotide identity (ANI) to known species, suggesting a novel organism. This strain demonstrated high-level resistance \[minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) >256 mg/L\] to third-generation cephalosporins, including ceftazidime, cefpodoxime, combination ceftazidime/avibactam, and the fourth-generation cephalosporin cefepime. The results of a comparative genomic analysis revealed that 179-BFC-A-HST is most closely related to _Virgibacillus halophilus_ 5B73CT _,_ sharing an ANI of 78.7% and a digital DNA-DNA hybridization (dDDH) value of 23.5%, while their 16S rRNA gene sequences shared 97.7% nucleotide identity. Based on these results and the recent recognition that the genus _Virgibacillus_ is polyphyletic, strain 179-BFC-A-HST is proposed as a novel species of a novel genus, _Tigheibacillus jepli_ gen. nov., sp. nov (type strain 179-BFC-A-HST = DSM 115946T = NRRL B-65666T), and its closest neighbor, _V. halophilus_, is proposed to be reassigned to this genus as _Tigheibacillus halophilus_ comb. nov. (type strain 5B73CT = DSM 21623T = JCM 21758T = KCTC 13935T). It was also necessary to reclassify its second closest neighbor _Virgibacillus soli,_ as a member of a novel genus _Paracerasibacillus_, reflecting its phylogenetic position relative to the genus _Cerasibacillus_, for which we propose _Paracerasibacillus soli_ comb. nov. (type strain CC-YMP-6T = DSM 22952T = CCM 7714T). Within _Amphibacillaceae_ ( _n_ = 64), _P. soli_ exhibited 11 antibiotic resistance genes (ARG), while _T. jepli_ encoded for 3, lacking any known β-lactamases, suggesting resistance from variant penicillin-binding proteins, disrupting cephalosporin efficacy. _P. soli_ was highly resistant to azithromycin (MIC >64 mg/L) yet susceptible to cephalosporins and penicillins.
