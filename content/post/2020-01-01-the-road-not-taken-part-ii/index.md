**_by Gayathri Sambamoorthy (and Karthik Raman)_**

One student questioned me,
"Is your research about the evolution of microorganisms?" I smiled in
happiness that she got something from what I spoke! "Great! Not really! I
am coming to that! My research is about understanding how evolution alters
reactions in an organism. When the microorganisms evolve, new reactions are
added to the pathways. When I mean evolution, it doesn't just have to be the
addition of new reactions. There can also be the removal of reactions from the
pathway if the organism thinks it is of no use anymore!"

Yamini, patiently listening to
everything, commented, "Even such small organisms are clever!"

I laughed at the childish way she
said that, although I was happy she was trying to comprehend all that I had
said so far. The students were astonished at how such tiny organisms have
robust mechanisms for survival.

Now, I threw some more questions for
the students to ponder: "Organisms get new reactions as they evolve, but
are there new synthetic lethals also? Are synthetic lethals unique to the
environments in which the organisms grow? How similar or different are the
reactions that form synthetic lethals?"

The students were seriously
thinking over. I continued, "These are some of the questions I wanted to
answer with my research! We do this on a computer, evolve microorganisms,
mimicking what happens in nature."

One student duly asked, "How do you do that using a
computer?"

I sighed. "It's a long
process. To keep it simple, we add one reaction and remove one reaction at a
time and further continue the process of evolving a metabolic network. We
evolved 2000 metabolic networks and found which reactions form synthetic
lethals (a computer-intensive procedure) in 10 different nutrient conditions.
As I had mentioned before, synthetic lethals increase robustness in organisms.
If that's the case, do microbes that exist in nature have many such synthetic
lethals for them to be robust? We compared the synthetic lethals in a natural
organism, _E. coli_ (to keep it simple,
let me tell you, it's _a_ bacterium), with those of the metabolic networks
we evolved. We found that nature does preserve a lot of these synthetic
lethals, and they are higher in number than the evolved metabolic networks in
all the nutrient conditions we studied."

"Next, we looked if these
synthetic lethals vary with different environments. We found that some
synthetic lethals are common across different environments we studied. A larger
portion of the synthetic lethals was uncommon, in the sense that they were
unique to environments."

"Now that we find a large
number of synthetic lethals in these evolved metabolic networks, if we consider
one reaction at a time, with how many other reactions do they form synthetic
lethal pairs? Can you guess between what numbers these would lie?"

One student replied, "10 to
50". Another said, "30 to 100". I let them keep guessing so that
they think for some time. "From our research, we could find that these
numbers vary largely from 1 to 266!"

They were all surprised. "Fascinating,
right? Do you know which reaction is the one that forms synthetic lethals with
266 other reactions? That is the reaction that forms the energy molecule of the
cell called ATP! Interesting, right? Upon evolution, they not only add new
reactions but also ensure that they add the right ones!"

"Then we went ahead to
analyse how similar or different reactions form synthetic lethals. To our
surprise, we found that the reactions were very different from each other and
belonged to very divergent pathways."

A student still thinking asked, "But what is the need
to analyse and understand all this?" I explained, "Studying these
synthetic lethals and their evolution in metabolic networks will give us an
idea of the redundant mechanisms that organisms can acquire. We now understand
the possible redundancies that can exist as organisms evolve. These would give
us insights into the basic design approach that microbes have and also how they
increase their robustness. We can thus target reactions that do not form
synthetic lethal with another reaction for microbes that cause diseases, to
develop a medicine!"

She was happy with my answer! I
greeted the class and asked them to mail me any further questions. I saw the
look on Yamini's face. She was awestruck! I knew that she would have understood
only a little of my studies that led to the roads not taken by the microbes. Nevertheless,
I left with the contentment that I could make her ponder on my research.
