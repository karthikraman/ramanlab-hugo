title: AICTE Short Term Training Programme on Computational Systems Biology

---
**Dates: Feb 6-11, 2017** **Venue: Department of Biotechnology, Bhupat and Jyoti Mehta School of Biosciences, IIT** Madras

The primary goal of this short-term training program is to educate the participants in both fundamental and advanced concepts in computational systems biology. The course will also provide an opportunity for the participants to get hands-on training in computational skills and tools that are required for research in systems biology. All the lectures and laboratory sessions will be handled by distinguished faculty members and experienced researchers. Some of the key questions we will seek to answer are:

- How can we model complex biological systems at various levels?
- How can we represent/visualise/analyse massive biological networks?
- How do biological systems respond to perturbations?
- What are the challenges in modelling biological systems?

### Course Outline

- Fundamentals of mathematical modelling
- Introduction to Network Biology
- Ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based modelling of biological networks
- Parameter Estimation
- Constraint-based modelling of metabolic networks
- Applications of constraint-based modelling in metabolic engineering
- Modelling human metabolic networks
- Modelling gene regulatory networks
- Lab sessions involving MATLAB, Cytoscape, COBRA Toolbox

In additional to the instructional talks on the above topics, we will also have 5-6 research talks on closely related topics, giving a glimpse of the exciting research happening in the areas of systems biology.
