title: It takes two to tango — making bio-production more economical

---
**_by Aditi Jain_**

> **[Dr Karthik Raman](https://rbcdsai.iitm.ac.in/people/karthik-raman/)**, an Associate Professor at IIT Madras and a core member of RBCDSAI, realized this issue as a major bottleneck hampering the commercialization of bioprocesses. He, together with Lavanya Raajaraam, his PhD student, decided to find a solution to this problem. As a microbe produces many metabolites so they thought one should work to optimize the production of metabolites so as to get a minimum quantity of at least two industrially important metabolites to make the bioprocess economically feasible. The research team has developed a new algorithm co-FSEOF (co-production using Flux Scanning based on Enforced Objective Flux) to solve this problem. This research study has been published in the international journal, _Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology_.

> “Bioprocesses are often limited by feasibility and yield. Even after various strain improvements, a process might not be economically feasible. To overcome this issue, we can co-produce multiple metabolites in a single process. However, there is a lack of algorithms available for rational strain engineering for co-production,” says Dr Raman.
