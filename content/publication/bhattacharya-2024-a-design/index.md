abstract: Establishing a mapping between (from and to) the functionality of interest
  and the underlying network structure (design principles) remains a crucial step
  toward understanding and design of bio-systems. Perfect adaptation is one such crucial
  functionality that enables every living organism to regulate its essential activities
  in the presence of external disturbances. Previous approaches to deducing the design
  principles for adaptation have either relied on computationally burdensome brute-force
  methods or rule-based design strategies detecting only a subset of all possible
  adaptive network structures. This chapter outlines a scalable and generalizable
  method inspired by systems theory that unravels an exhaustive set of adaptation-capable
  structures. We first use the well-known performance parameters to characterize perfect
  adaptation. These performance parameters are then mapped back to a few parameters
  (poles, zeros, gain) characteristic of the underlying dynamical system constituted
  by the rate equations. Therefore, the performance parameters evaluated for the scenario
  of perfect adaptation can be expressed as a set of precise mathematical conditions
  involving the system parameters. Finally, we use algebraic graph theory to translate
  these abstract mathematical conditions to certain structural requirements for adaptation.
  The proposed algorithm does not assume any particular dynamics and is applicable
  to networks of any size. Moreover, the results offer a significant advancement in
  the realm of understanding and designing complex biochemical networks.
