abstract: In biological systems, individual phenotypes are typically adopted by multiple
  genotypes. Examples include protein structure phenotypes, where each structure can
  be adopted by a myriad individual amino acid sequence genotypes. These genotypes
  form vast connected 'neutral networks' in genotype space. The size of such neutral
  networks endows biological systems not only with robustness to genetic change, but
  also with the ability to evolve a vast number of novel phenotypes that occur near
  any one neutral network. Whether technological systems can be designed to have similar
  properties is poorly understood. Here we ask this question for a class of programmable
  electronic circuits that compute digital logic functions. The functional flexibility
  of such circuits is important in many applications, including applications of evolutionary
  principles to circuit design. The functions they compute are at the heart of all
  digital computation. We explore a vast space of 1045 logic circuits ('genotypes')
  and 1019 logic functions ('phenotypes'). We demonstrate that circuits that compute
  the same logic function are connected in large neutral networks that span circuit
  space. Their robustness or fault-tolerance varies very widely. The vicinity of each
  neutral network contains circuits with a broad range of novel functions. Two circuits
  computing different functions can usually be converted into one another via few
  changes in their architecture. These observations show that properties important
  for the evolvability of biological systems exist in a commercially important class
  of electronic circuitry. They also point to generic ways to generate fault-tolerant,
  adaptable and evolvable electronic circuitry.
