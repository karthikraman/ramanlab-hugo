abstract: 'Biological adaptation, the tendency of every living organism to regulate
  its essential activities in environmental fluctuations, is a well-studied functionality
  in systems and synthetic biology. In this work, we present a generic methodology
  inspired by systems theory to discover the design principles for robust adaptation,
  perfect and imperfect, in two different contexts: (1)~in the presence of deterministic
  external and parametric disturbances and (2)~in a stochastic setting. In all the
  cases, firstly, we translate the necessary qualitative conditions for adaptation
  to mathematical constraints using the language of systems theory, which we then
  map back as design requirements for the underlying networks. Thus, contrary to the
  existing approaches, the proposed methodologies provide an exhaustive set of admissible
  network structures without resorting to computationally burdensome brute-force techniques.
  Further, the proposed frameworks do not assume prior knowledge about the particular
  rate kinetics, thereby validating the conclusions for a large class of biological
  networks. In the deterministic setting, we show that unlike the incoherent feed-forward
  network structures (IFFLP), the modules containing negative feedback with buffer
  action (NFBLB) are robust to parametric fluctuations when a specific part of the
  network is assumed to remain unaffected. To this end, we propose a sufficient condition
  for imperfect adaptation and show that adding negative feedback in an IFFLP topology
  improves the robustness concerning parametric fluctuations. Further, we propose
  a stricter set of necessary conditions for imperfect adaptation. Turning to the
  stochastic scenario, we adopt a Wiener-Kolmogorov filter strategy to tune the parameters
  of a given network structure towards minimum output variance. We show that both
  NFBLB and IFFLP can be used as a reduced-order W-K filter. Further, we define the
  notion of nearest neighboring motifs to compare the output variances across different
  network structures. We argue that the NFBLB achieves adaptation at the cost of a
  variance higher than its nearest neighboring motifs whereas the IFFLP topology produces
  locally minimum variance while compared with its nearest neighboring motifs. We
  present numerical simulations to support the theoretical results. Overall, our results
  present a generic, systematic, and robust framework for advancing the understanding
  of complex biological networks.'
