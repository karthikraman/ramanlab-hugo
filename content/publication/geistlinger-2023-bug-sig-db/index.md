abstract: The literature of human and other host-associated microbiome studies is
  expanding rapidly, but systematic comparisons among published results of host-associated
  microbiome signatures of differential abundance remain difficult. We present BugSigDB,
  a community-editable database of manually curated microbial signatures from published
  differential abundance studies accompanied by information on study geography, health
  outcomes, host body site and experimental, epidemiological and statistical methods
  using controlled vocabulary. The initial release of the database contains $>$2,500
  manually curated signatures from $>$600 published studies on three host species,
  enabling high-throughput analysis of signature similarity, taxon enrichment, co-occurrence
  and coexclusion and consensus signatures. These data allow assessment of microbiome
  differential abundance within and across experimental conditions, environments or
  body sites. Database-wide analysis reveals experimental conditions with the highest
  level of consistency in signatures reported by independent studies and identifies
  commonalities among disease-associated signatures, including frequent introgression
  of oral pathobionts into the gut.
