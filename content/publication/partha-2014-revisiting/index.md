abstract: Robustness and evolvability are highly intertwined properties of biological
  systems. The relationship between these properties determines how biological systems
  are able to withstand mutations and show variation in response to them. Computational
  studies have explored the relationship between these two properties using neutral
  networks of RNA sequences (genotype) and their secondary structures (phenotype)
  as a model system. However, these studies have assumed every mutation to a sequence
  to be equally likely; the differences in the likelihood of the occurrence of various
  mutations, and the consequence of probabilistic nature of the mutations in such
  a system have previously been ignored. Associating probabilities to mutations essentially
  results in the weighting of genotype space. We here perform a comparative analysis
  of weighted and unweighted neutral networks of RNA sequences, and subsequently explore
  the relationship between robustness and evolvability. We show that assuming an equal
  likelihood for all mutations (as in an unweighted network), underestimates robustness
  and overestimates evolvability of a system. In spite of discarding this assumption,
  we observe that a negative correlation between sequence (genotype) robustness and
  sequence evolvability persists, and also that structure (phenotype) robustness promotes
  structure evolvability, as observed in earlier studies using unweighted networks.
  We also study the effects of base composition bias on robustness and evolvability.
  Particularly, we explore the association between robustness and evolvability in
  a sequence space that is AU-rich â€“ sequences with an AU content of 80% or higher,
  compared to a normal (unbiased) sequence space. We find that evolvability of both
  sequences and structures in an AU-rich space is lesser compared to the normal space,
  and robustness higher. We also observe that AU-rich populations evolving on neutral
  networks of phenotypes, can access less phenotypic variation compared to normal
  populations evolving on neutral networks.
