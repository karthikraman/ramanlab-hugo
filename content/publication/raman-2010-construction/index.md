abstract: Protein-protein interactions form the basis for a vast majority of cellular
  events, including signal transduction and transcriptional regulation. It is now
  understood that the study of interactions between cellular macromolecules is fundamental
  to the understanding of biological systems. Interactions between proteins have been
  studied through a number of high-throughput experiments and have also been predicted
  through an array of computational methods that leverage the vast amount of sequence
  data generated in the last decade. In this review, I discuss some of the important
  computational methods for the prediction of functional linkages between proteins.
  I then give a brief overview of some of the databases and tools that are useful
  for a study of protein-protein interactions. I also present an introduction to network
  theory, followed by a discussion of the parameters commonly used in analysing networks,
  important network topologies, as well as methods to identify important network components,
  based on perturbations.
