abstract: Establishing a mapping between the emergent biological properties and the
  repository of network structures has been of great relevance in systems and synthetic
  biology. Adaptation is one such biological property of paramount importance that
  promotes regulation in the presence of environmental disturbances. This paper presents
  a nonlinear systems theory-driven framework to identify the design principles for
  perfect adaptation with respect to external disturbances of arbitrary magnitude.
  Based on the prior information about the network, we frame precise mathematical
  conditions for adaptation using nonlinear systems theory. We first deduce the mathematical
  conditions for perfect adaptation for constant input disturbances. Subsequently,
  we translate these conditions to specific necessary structural requirements for
  adaptation in networks of small size and then extend to argue that there exist only
  two classes of architectures for a network of any size that can provide local adaptation
  in the entire state space, namely, incoherent feed-forward (IFF) structure and negative
  feedback loop with buffer node (NFB). The additional positiveness constraints further
  narrow the admissible set of network structures. This also aids in establishing
  the global asymptotic stability for the steady state given a constant input disturbance.
  The proposed method does not assume any explicit knowledge of the underlying rate
  kinetics, barring some minimal assumptions. Finally, we also discuss the infeasibility
  of certain IFF networks in providing adaptation in the presence of downstream connections.
  Moreover, we propose a generic and novel algorithm based on non-linear systems theory
  to unravel the design principles for global adaptation. Detailed and extensive simulation
  studies corroborate the theoretical findings.
