abstract: Essential gene prediction models built so far are heavily reliant on sequence-based
  features, and the scope of network-based features has been narrow. Previous work
  from our group demonstrated the importance of using network-based features for predicting
  essential genes with high accuracy. Here, we apply our approach for the prediction
  of essential genes to organisms from the STRING database and host the results in
  a standalone website. Our database, NetGenes, contains essential gene predictions
  for 2,700+ bacteria predicted using features derived from STRING proteinâ€“ protein
  functional association networks. Housing a total of over 2.1 million genes, NetGenes
  offers various features like essentiality scores, annotations, and feature vectors
  for each gene. NetGenes database is available from https://rbc-dsai-iitm.github.io/NetGenes/.
