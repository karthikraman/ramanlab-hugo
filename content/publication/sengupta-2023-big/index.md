abstract: Microorganisms are ubiquitous in nature and form complex community networks
  to survive in various environments. This community structure depends on numerous
  factors like nutrient availability, abiotic factors like temperature and pH as well
  as microbial composition. Categorising accessible biomes according to their habitats
  would help in understanding the complexity of the environment-specific communities.
  Owing to the recent improvements in sequencing facilities, researchers have started
  to explore diverse microbiomes rapidly and attempts have been made to study microbial
  crosstalk. However, different metagenomics sampling, preprocessing, and annotation
  methods make it difficult to compare multiple studies and hinder the recycling of
  data. Huge datasets originating from these experiments demand systematic computational
  methods to extract biological information beyond microbial compositions. Further
  exploration of microbial co-occurring patterns across the biomes could help us in
  designing cross-biome experiments. In this review, we catalogue databases with system-specific
  microbiomes, discussing publicly available common databases as well as specialised
  databases for a range of microbiomes. If the new datasets generated in the future
  could maintain at least biome-specific annotation, then researchers could use those
  contemporary tools for relevant and bias-free analysis of complex metagenomics data.
