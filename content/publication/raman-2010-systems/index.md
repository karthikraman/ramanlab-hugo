abstract: The complex web of interactions between the host immune system and the pathogen
  determines the outcome of any infection. A computational model of this interaction
  network, which encodes complex interplay among host and bacterial components, forms
  a useful basis for improving the understanding of pathogenesis, in filling knowledge
  gaps and consequently to identify strategies to counter the disease. We have built
  an extensive model of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis host-pathogen interactome,
  consisting of 75 nodes corresponding to host and pathogen molecules, cells, cellular
  states or processes. Vaccination effects, clearance efficiencies due to drugs and
  growth rates have also been encoded in the model. The system is modelled as a Boolean
  network. Virtual deletion experiments, multiple parameter scans and analysis of
  the system's response to perturbations, indicate that disabling processes such as
  phagocytosis and phagolysosome fusion or cytokines such as TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma,
  greatly impaired bacterial clearance, while removing cytokines such as IL-10 alongside
  bacterial defence proteins such as SapM greatly favour clearance. Simulations indicate
  a high propensity of the pathogen to persist under different conditions.
