 abstract = {Tuberculosis has been a global health concern for decades and the emergence of resistant strains and co-infection with HIV warrant newer approaches to identify anti-tubercular drugs and targets. The availability of many `omics'-scale datasets, together with the advances in computation and modelling have enabled the application of several systems-level modelling techniques in drug discovery. In this chapter, we focus on how systems-level modelling of Mycobacterium tuberculosis can provide us insights on various aspects of the pathogen, from metabolic pathways to protein--protein interaction networks, and how such models lend themselves to the identification of new and potentially improved drug targets. We present a brief overview of the modelling of mycobacterial metabolism, transcriptome and host-pathogen interactions, as well as how various models can be exploited for a rational identification of potential drug targets. Systems-level modelling and simulation of pathogenic organisms has an immense potential to impact most drug discovery programmes.},
