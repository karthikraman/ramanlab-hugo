abstract: Tuberculosis has been a global health concern for decades and the emergence
  of resistant strains and co-infection with HIV warrant newer approaches to identify
  anti-tubercular drugs and targets. The availability of many `omics'-scale datasets,
  together with the advances in computation and modelling have enabled the application
  of several systems-level modelling techniques in drug discovery. In this chapter,
  we focus on how systems-level modelling of Mycobacterium tuberculosis can provide
  us insights on various aspects of the pathogen, from metabolic pathways to protein--protein
  interaction networks, and how such models lend themselves to the identification
  of new and potentially improved drug targets. We present a brief overview of the
  modelling of mycobacterial metabolism, transcriptome and host-pathogen interactions,
  as well as how various models can be exploited for a rational identification of
  potential drug targets. Systems-level modelling and simulation of pathogenic organisms
  has an immense potential to impact most drug discovery programmes.
