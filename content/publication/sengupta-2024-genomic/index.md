abstract: The International Space Station (ISS) stands as a testament to human achievement
  in space exploration. Despite its highly controlled environment, characterised by
  microgravity, increased CO$$_2$$levels, and elevated solar radiation, microorganisms
  occupy a unique niche. These microbial inhabitants play a significant role in influencing
  the health and well-being of astronauts on board. One microorganism of particular
  interest in our study is Enterobacter~bugandensis, primarily found in clinical specimens
  including the human gastrointestinal tract, and also reported to possess pathogenic
  traits, leading to a plethora of infections.
