abstract: Computational modelling of biological processes poses multiple challenges
  in each stage of the modelling exercise. Some significant challenges include identifiability,
  precisely estimating parameters from limited data, informative experiments and anisotropic
  sensitivity in the parameter space. One of these challenges' crucial but inconspicuous
  sources is the possible presence of large regions in the parameter space over which
  model predictions are nearly identical. This property, known as sloppiness, has
  been reasonably well-addressed in the past decade, studying its possible impacts
  and remedies. However, certain critical unanswered questions concerning sloppiness,
  particularly related to its quantification and practical implications in various
  stages of system identification, still prevail. In this work, we systematically
  examine sloppiness at a fundamental level and formalise two new theoretical definitions
  of sloppiness. Using the proposed definitions, we establish a mathematical relationship
  between the parameter estimates' precision and sloppiness in linear predictors.
  Further, we develop a novel computational method and a visual tool to assess the
  goodness of a model around a point in parameter space by identifying local structural
  identifiability and sloppiness and finding the most sensitive and least sensitive
  parameters for non-infinitesimal perturbations. We demonstrate the working of our
  method in benchmark systems biology models of various complexities. The pharmacokinetic
  HIV infection model analysis identified a new set of biologically relevant parameters
  that can be used to control the free virus in an active HIV infection.
