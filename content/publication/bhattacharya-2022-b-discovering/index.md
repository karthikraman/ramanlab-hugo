abstract: Network architecture plays a crucial role in governing the dynamics of any
  biological network. Further, network structures have been shown to remain conserved
  across organisms for a given phenotype. Therefore, the mapping between network structures
  and the output functionality not only aids in understanding of biological systems
  but also finds application in synthetic biology and therapeutics. Based on the approaches
  involved, most of the efforts hitherto invested in this field can be classified
  into three broad categories, namely, computational efforts, rule-based methods and
  systems-theoretic approaches. The present review provides a qualitative and quantitative
  study of all three approaches in the light of three well-researched biological phenotypes,
  namely, oscillation, toggle switching, and adaptation. We also discuss the advantages,
  limitations, and future research scope for all three approaches along with their
  possible applications to other emergent properties of biological relevance.
