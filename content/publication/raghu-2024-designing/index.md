abstract: Microorganisms exist in large communities of diverse species, exhibiting
  various functionalities. The mammalian gut microbiome, for instance, has the functionality
  of digesting dietary fibre and producing different short-chain fatty acids. Not
  all microbes present in a community contribute to a given functionality; it is possible
  to find a minimal microbiome, which is a subset of the large microbiome, that is
  capable of performing the functionality while maintaining other community properties
  such as growth rate and metabolite production. Such a minimal microbiome will also
  contain keystone species for SCFA production in that community. In this work, we
  present a systematic constraint-based approach to identify a minimal microbiome
  from a large community for a user-proposed function. We employ a top-down approach
  with sequential deletion followed by solving a mixed-integer linear programming
  problem with the objective of minimising the L1-norm of the membership vector. Notably,
  we consider quantitative measures of community growth rate and metabolite production
  rates. We demonstrate the utility of our algorithm by identifying the minimal microbiomes
  corresponding to three model communities of the gut, and discuss their validity
  based on the presence of the keystone species in the community. Our approach is
  generic, flexible and finds application in studying a variety of microbial communities.
  The algorithm is available from https://github.com/RamanLab/minMicrobiome.
