 abstract = {Stoichiometric and constraint-based analyses of metabolic pathways have been gaining ground in the recent past with the increase in the quality and number of pathway databases available and the curation of genome-scale metabolic models. Genome-scale metabolic models of several organisms such as Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Staphylococcus aureus have already been constructed. Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) and Minimisation of Metabolic Adjustment (MoMA) are two of the popular techniques for the constraint-based analysis of metabolic pathways.We have developed a computational tool, PathwayAnalyser, for the analysis of metabolic pathways, particularly by FBA and MoMA. PathwayAnalyser interfaces with the open-source GNU Linear Programming Toolkit (GLPK) for linear programming/FBA and Object Oriented Quadratic Programming (OOQP) for quadratic programming/MoMA. It gives a comprehensive report on gene deletions from the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) Model and objective function input for FBA. PathwayAnalyser is open-source and is available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/pathwayanalyser},
