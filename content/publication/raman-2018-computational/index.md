abstract: In this chapter, we describe Fast-SL, an in silico approach to predict synthetic
  lethals in genome-scale metabolic models. Synthetic lethals are sets of genes or
  reactions where only the simultaneous removal of all genes or reactions in the set
  abolishes growth of an organism. In silico approaches to predict synthetic lethals
  are based on Flux Balance Analysis (FBA), a popular constraint-based analysis method
  based on linear programming. FBA has been shown to accurately predict the viability
  of various genome-scale metabolic models. Fast-SL builds on the framework of FBA
  and enables the prediction of synthetic lethal reactions or genes in different organisms,
  under various environmental conditions. Predicting synthetic lethals in metabolic
  network models allows us to generate hypotheses on possible novel genetic interactions
  and potential candidates for combinatorial therapy, in case of pathogenic organisms.
  We here summarize the Fast-SL approach for analyzing metabolic networks and detail
  the procedure to predict synthetic lethals in any given metabolic model. We illustrate
  the approach by predicting synthetic lethals in Escherichia coli. The Fast-SL implementation
  for MATLAB is available from https://github.com/RamanLab/FastSL/ .
