abstract: Several types of networks, such as transcriptional, metabolic or protein-protein
  interaction networks of various organisms have been constructed, that have provided
  a variety of insights into metabolism and regulation. Here, we seek to exploit the
  reaction-based networks of three organisms for comparative genomics. We use concepts
  from spectral graph theory to systematically determine how differences in basic
  metabolism of organisms are reflected at the systems level and in the overall topological
  structures of their metabolic networks. Metabolome-based reaction networks of Mycobacterium
  tuberculosis, Mycobacterium leprae and Escherichia coli have been constructed based
  on the KEGG LIGAND database, followed by graph spectral analysis of the network
  to identify hubs as well as the sub-clustering of reactions. The shortest and alternate
  paths in the reaction networks have also been examined. Sub-cluster profiling demonstrates
  that reactions of the mycolic acid pathway in mycobacteria form a tightly connected
  sub-cluster. Identification of hubs reveals reactions involving glutamate to be
  central to mycobacterial metabolism, and pyruvate to be at the centre of the E.
  coli metabolome. The analysis of shortest paths between reactions has revealed several
  paths that are shorter than well established pathways. We conclude that severe downsizing
  of the leprae genome has not significantly altered the global structure of its reaction
  network but has reduced the total number of alternate paths between its reactions
  while keeping the shortest paths between them intact. The hubs in the mycobacterial
  networks that are absent in the human metabolome can be explored as potential drug
  targets. This work demonstrates the usefulness of constructing metabolome based
  networks of organisms and the feasibility of their analyses through graph spectral
  methods. The insights obtained from such studies provide a broad overview of the
  similarities and differences between organisms, taking comparative genomics studies
  to a higher dimension.
