abstract: Camptothecin (CPT) is a vital monoterpene indole alkaloid used in anti-cancer
  therapeutics. It is primarily derived from Camptotheca acuminata and Nothapodytes
  nimmoniana plants that are indigenous to Southeast Asia. Plants have intricate metabolic
  networks and use them to produce secondary metabolites such as CPT, which is a prerequisite
  for rational metabolic engineering design to optimize their production. By reconstructing
  metabolic models, we can predict plant metabolic behavior, facilitating the selection
  of suitable approaches and saving time, cost, and energy, over traditional hit and
  trial experimental approaches. In this study, we reconstructed a genome-scale metabolic
  model for N. nimmoniana (NothaGEM iSM1809) and curated it using experimentally obtained
  biochemical data. We also used in silico tools to identify and rank suitable enzyme
  targets for overexpression and knockout to maximize camptothecin production. The
  predicted over-expression targets encompass enzymes involved in the camptothecin
  biosynthesis pathway, including strictosidine synthase and geraniol 10-hydroxylase,
  as well as targets related to plant metabolism, such as amino acid biosynthesis
  and the tricarboxylic acid cycle. The top-ranked knockout targets included reactions
  responsible for the formation of folates and serine, as well as the conversion of
  acetyl CoA and oxaloacetate to malate and citrate. One of the top-ranked overexpression
  targets, strictosidine synthase, was chosen to generate metabolically engineered
  cell lines of N. nimmoniana using Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation.
  The transformed cell line showed a 5-fold increase in camptothecin production, with
  a yield of up to 5 µg g−1.
