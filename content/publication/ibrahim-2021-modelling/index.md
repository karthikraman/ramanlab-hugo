abstract: Microbes propagate and thrive in complex communities, and there are many
  benefits to studying and engineering microbial communities instead of single strains.
  Microbial communities are being increasingly leveraged in biotechnological applications,
  as they present significant advantages such as the division of labour and improved
  substrate utilisation. Nevertheless, they also present some interesting challenges
  to surmount for the design of efficient biotechnological processes. In this review,
  we discuss key principles of microbial interactions, followed by a deep dive into
  genome-scale metabolic models, focussing on a vast repertoire of constraint-based
  modelling methods that enable us to characterise and understand the metabolic capabilities
  of microbial communities. Complementary approaches to model microbial communities,
  such as those based on graph theory, are also briefly discussed. Taken together,
  these methods provide rich insights into the interactions between microbes and how
  they influence microbial community productivity. We finally overview approaches
  that allow us to generate and test numerous synthetic community compositions, followed
  by tools and methodologies that can predict effective genetic interventions to further
  improve the productivity of communities. With impending advancements in high-throughput
  omics of microbial communities, the stage is set for the rapid expansion of microbial
  community engineering, with a significant impact on biotechnological processes.
