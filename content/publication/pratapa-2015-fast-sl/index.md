abstract: 'Motivation: Synthetic lethal sets are sets of reactions/genes where only
  the simultaneous removal of all reactions/genes in the set abolishes growth of an
  organism. Previous approaches to identify synthetic lethal genes in genome-scale
  metabolic networks have built on the framework of flux balance analysis (FBA), extending
  it either to exhaustively analyze all possible combinations of genes or formulate
  the problem as a bi-level mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem. We here
  propose an algorithm, Fast-SL, which surmounts the computational complexity of previous
  approaches by iteratively reducing the search space for synthetic lethals, resulting
  in a substantial reduction in running time, even for higher order synthetic lethals.'
