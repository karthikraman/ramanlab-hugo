abstract: 'With the advent of long-term human habitation in space and on the moon,
  understanding how the built environment microbiome of space habitats differs from
  Earth habitats, and how microbes survive, proliferate and spread in space conditions,
  is becoming more important. The microbial tracking mission series has been monitoring
  the microbiome of the International Space Station (ISS) for almost a decade. During
  this mission series, six unique strains of Gram-stain-positive bacteria, including
  two spore-forming and three non-spore-forming species, were isolated from the environmental
  surfaces of the ISS. The analysis of their 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed textgreater 99%
  similarities with previously described bacterial species. To further explore their
  phylogenetic affiliation, whole genome sequencing was undertaken. For all strains,
  the gyrB gene exhibited textless 93% similarity with closely related species, which
  proved effective in categorizing these ISS strains as novel species. Average nucleotide
  identity and digital DNA–DNA hybridization values, when compared to any known bacterial
  species, were textless 94% and textless50% respectively for all species described
  here. Traditional biochemical tests, fatty acid profiling, polar lipid, and cell
  wall composition analyses were performed to generate phenotypic characterization
  of these ISS strains. A study of the shotgun metagenomic reads from the ISS samples,
  from which the novel species were isolated, showed that only 0.1% of the total reads
  mapped to the novel species, supporting the idea that these novel species are rare
  in the ISS environments. In-depth annotation of the genomes unveiled a variety of
  genes linked to amino acid and derivative synthesis, carbohydrate metabolism, cofactors,
  vitamins, prosthetic groups, pigments, and protein metabolism. Further analysis
  of these ISS-isolated organisms revealed that, on average, they contain 46 genes
  associated with virulence, disease, and defense. The main predicted functions of
  these genes are: conferring resistance to antibiotics and toxic compounds, and enabling
  invasion and intracellular resistance. After conducting antiSMASH analysis, it was
  found that there are roughly 16 cluster types across the six strains, including
  β-lactone and type III polyketide synthase (T3PKS) clusters. Based on these multi-faceted
  taxonomic methods, it was concluded that these six ISS strains represent five novel
  species, which we propose to name as follows: Arthrobacter burdickii IIF3SC-B10T
  (= NRRL B-65660T = DSM 115933T), Leifsonia virtsii F6_8S_P_1AT (= NRRL B-65661T
  = DSM 115931T), Leifsonia williamsii F6_8S_P_1BT (= NRRL B-65662T = DSM 115932T),
  Paenibacillus vandeheii F6_3S_P_1CT (= NRRL B-65663T = DSM 115940T), and Sporosarcina
  highlanderae F6_3S_P_2T (= NRRL B-65664T = DSM 115943T). Identifying and characterizing
  the genomes and phenotypes of novel microbes found in space habitats, like those
  explored in this study, is integral for expanding our genomic databases of space-relevant
  microbes. This approach offers the only reliable method to determine species composition,
  track microbial dispersion, and anticipate potential threats to human health from
  monitoring microbes on the surfaces and equipment within space habitats. By unraveling
  these microbial mysteries, we take a crucial step towards ensuring the safety and
  success of future space missions.'
