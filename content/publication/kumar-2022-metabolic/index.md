abstract: Recent studies have provided insights into the persistence and succession
  of microbes aboard the International Space Station (ISS), notably the dominance
  of Klebsiella pneumoniae. However, the interactions between the various microbes
  aboard the ISS and how they shape the microbiome remain to be clearly understood.
  In this study, we apply a computational approach to predict possible metabolic interactions
  in the ISS microbiome and shed further light on its organization.
