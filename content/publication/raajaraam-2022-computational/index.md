abstract: Microbial production of chemicals is a more sustainable alternative to traditional
  chemical processes. However, the shift to bioprocess is usually accompanied by a
  drop in economic feasibility. Co-production of more than one chemical can improve
  the economy of bioprocesses, enhance carbon utilization and also ensure better exploitation
  of resources. While a number of tools exist for in silico metabolic engineering,
  there is a dearth of computational tools that can co-optimize the production of
  multiple metabolites. In this work, we propose co-FSEOF (co-production using Flux
  Scanning based on Enforced Objective Flux), an algorithm designed to identify intervention
  strategies to co-optimize the production of a set of metabolites. Co-FSEOF can be
  used to identify all pairs of products that can be co-optimized with ease using
  a single intervention. Beyond this, it can also identify higher-order intervention
  strategies for a given set of metabolites. We have employed this tool on the genome-scale
  metabolic models of Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and identified
  intervention targets that can co-optimize the production of pairs of metabolites
  under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Anaerobic conditions were found to
  support the co-production of a higher number of metabolites when compared to aerobic
  conditions in both organisms. The proposed computational framework will enhance
  the ease of study of metabolite co-production and thereby aid the design of better
  bioprocesses.
