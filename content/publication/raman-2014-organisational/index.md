abstract: Protein networks, describing physical interactions as well as functional
  associations between proteins, have been unravelled for many organisms in the recent
  past. Databases such as the STRING provide excellent resources for the analysis
  of such networks. In this contribution, we revisit the organisation of protein networks,
  particularly the centrality–lethality hypothesis, which hypothesises that nodes
  with higher centrality in a network are more likely to produce lethal phenotypes
  on removal, compared to nodes with lower centrality. We consider the protein networks
  of a diverse set of 20 organisms, with essentiality information available in the
  Database of Essential Genes and assess the relationship between centrality measures
  and lethality. For each of these organisms, we obtained networks of high-confidence
  interactions from the STRING database, and computed network parameters such as degree,
  betweenness centrality, closeness centrality and pairwise disconnectivity indices.
  We observe that the networks considered here are predominantly disassortative. Further,
  we observe that essential nodes in a network have a significantly higher average
  degree and betweenness centrality, compared to the network average. Most previous
  studies have evaluated the centrality–lethality hypothesis for Saccharomyces cerevisiae
  and Escherichia coli; we here observe that the centrality–lethality hypothesis hold
  goods for a large number of organisms, with certain limitations. Betweenness centrality
  may also be a useful measure to identify essential nodes, but measures like closeness
  centrality and pairwise disconnectivity are not significantly higher for essential
  nodes.
