abstract: "An astonishingly diverse biomolecular circuitry orchestrates the functioning\
  \ machinery underlying every living cell. These biomolecules and their circuits\
  \ have been engineered not only for various industrial applications but also to\
  \ perform other atypical functions that they were not evolved forâ€” including computation.\
  \ Various kinds of computational challenges, such as solving NP-complete problems\
  \ with many variables, logical computation, neural network operations, and cryptography,\
  \ have all been attempted through this unconventional computing paradigm. In this\
  \ review, we highlight key experiments across three different ``eras'' of molecular\
  \ computation, beginning with molecular solutions, transitioning to logic circuits\
  \ and ultimately, more complex molecular networks. We also discuss a variety of\
  \ applications of molecular computation, from solving NP-hard problems to self-assembled\
  \ nanostructures for delivering molecules, and provide a glimpse into the exciting\
  \ potential that molecular computing holds for the future. Also see the video abstract\
