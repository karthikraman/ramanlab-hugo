abstract: Loss of diversity in the gut microbiome can persist for extended periods
  after antibiotic treatment, impacting microbiome function, antimicrobial resistance
  and probably host health. Despite widespread antibiotic use, our understanding of
  the species and metabolic functions contributing to gut microbiome recovery is limited.
  Using data from 4 discovery cohorts in 3 continents comprising $>$500 microbiome
  profiles from 117 individuals, we identified 21 bacterial species exhibiting robust
  association with ecological recovery post antibiotic therapy. Functional and growth-rate
  analysis showed that recovery is supported by enrichment in specific carbohydrate-degradation
  and energy-production pathways. Association rule mining on 782 microbiome profiles
  from the MEDUSA database enabled reconstruction of the gut microbial ‘food web’,
  identifying many recovery-associated bacteria as keystone species, with the ability
  to use host- and diet-derived energy sources, and support repopulation of other
  gut species. Experiments in a mouse model recapitulated the ability of recovery-associated
  bacteria (Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and Bifidobacterium adolescentis) to promote
  recovery with synergistic effects, providing a boost of two orders of magnitude
  to microbial abundance in early time points and faster maturation of microbial diversity.
  The identification of specific species and metabolic functions promoting recovery
  opens up opportunities for rationally determining pre- and probiotic formulations
  offering protection from long-term consequences of frequent antibiotic usage.
