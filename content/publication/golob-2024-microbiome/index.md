abstract: $<$h2$>$Summary$<$/h2$><$p$>$Every year, 11% of infants are born preterm
  with significant health consequences, with the vaginal microbiome a risk factor
  for preterm birth. We crowdsource models to predict (1) preterm birth (PTB; $<$37
  weeks) or (2) early preterm birth (ePTB; $<$32 weeks) from 9 vaginal microbiome
  studies representing 3,578 samples from 1,268 pregnant individuals, aggregated from
  public raw data via phylogenetic harmonization. The predictive models are validated
  on two independent unpublished datasets representing 331 samples from 148 pregnant
  individuals. The top-performing models (among 148 and 121 submissions from 318 teams)
  achieve area under the receiver operator characteristic (AUROC) curve scores of
  0.69 and 0.87 predicting PTB and ePTB, respectively. Alpha diversity, VALENCIA community
  state types, and composition are important features in the top-performing models,
  most of which are tree-based methods. This work is a model for translation of microbiome
  data into clinically relevant predictive models and to better understand preterm
  birth.$<$/p$>$
