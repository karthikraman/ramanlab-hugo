abstract: 'The complexity of biological systems has intrigued scientists from many
  disciplines and has given birth to the highly influential field of systems biology
  wherein a wide array of mathematical techniques, such as flux balance analysis,
  and technology platforms, such as next generation sequencing, is used to understand,
  elucidate, and predict the functions of complex biological systems. More recently,
  the field of synthetic biology, i.e., de novo engineering of biological systems,
  has emerged. Scientists from various fields are focusing on how to render this engineering
  process more predictable, reliable, scalable, affordable, and easy. Systems and
  control theory is a branch of engineering and applied sciences that rigorously deals
  with the complexities and uncertainties of interconnected systems with the objective
  of characterising fundamental systemic properties such as stability, robustness,
  communication capacity, and other performance metrics. Systems and control theory
  also strives to offer concepts and methods that facilitate the design of systems
  with rigorous guarantees on these properties. Over the last 100 years, it has made
  stellar theoretical and technological contributions in diverse fields such as aerospace,
  telecommunication, storage, automotive, power systems, and others. Can it have,
  or evolve to have, a similar impact in biology? The chapters in this book demonstrate
  that, indeed, systems and control theoretic concepts and techniques can have a significant
  impact in systems and synthetic biology. Volume II contains chapters contributed
  by leading researchers in the field of systems and synthetic biology that concern
  modeling physiological processes and bottom-up constructions of scalable biological
  systems. The modeling problems include characterisation and synthesis of memory,
  understanding how homoeostasis is maintained in the face of shocks and relatively
  gradual perturbations, understanding the functioning and robustness of biological
  clocks such as those at the core of circadian rhythms, and understanding how the
  cell cycles can be regulated, among others. Some of the bottom-up construction problems
  investigated in Volume II are as follows: How should biomacromolecules, platforms,
  and scalable architectures be chosen and synthesised in order to build programmable
  de novo biological systems? What are the types of constrained optimisation problems
  encountered in this process and how can these be solved efficiently? As the eminent
  computer scientist Donald Knuth put it, \"biology easily has 500 years of exciting
  problems to work on\". This edited book presents but a small fraction of those for
  the benefit of (1) systems and control theorists interested in molecular and cellular
  biology and (2) biologists interested in rigorous modelling, analysis and control
  of biological systems.'
