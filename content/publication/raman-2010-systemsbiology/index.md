abstract: Abstract  Systems biology seeks to study biological systems as a whole,
  contrary to the reductionist approach that has dominated biology. Such a view of
  biological systems emanating from strong foundations of molecular level understanding
  of the individual components in terms of their form, function and interactions is
  promising to transform the level at which we understand biology. Systems are defined
  and abstracted at different levels, which are simulated and analysed using different
  types of mathematical and computational techniques. Insights obtained from systems
  level studies readily lend to their use in several applications in biotechnology
  and drug discovery, making it even more important to study systems as a whole.
