abstract: Microbial co-cultures have been used in several biotechnological applications.
  Within these co-cultures, the microorganisms tend to interact with each other and
  perform complex actions. Investigating metabolic interactions in microbial co-cultures
  is crucial in designing microbial consortia. Here, we present a pipeline integrating
  modelling and experimental approaches to understand metabolic interactions between
  organisms in a community. We define a new index named “Metabolic Support Index (MSI)”,
  which quantifies the benefits derived by each organism in the presence of the other
  when grown as a co-culture. We computed MSI for several experimentally demonstrated
  co-cultures and showed that MSI, as a metric, accurately identifies the organism
  that derives the maximum benefit. We also computed MSI for a commonly used yeast
  co-culture consisting of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Pichia stipitis and observed
  that the latter derives higher benefit from the interaction. Further, we designed
  two-stage experiments to study mutual interactions and showed that P. stipitis indeed
  derives the maximum benefit from the interaction, as shown from our computational
  predictions. Also, using our previously developed computational tool MetQuest, we
  identified all the metabolic exchanges happening between these organisms by analysing
  the pathways spanning the two organisms. By analysing the HPLC profiles and studying
  the isotope labelling, we show that P. stipitis consumes the ethanol produced by
  S. cerevisiae when grown on glucose-rich medium under aerobic conditions, as also
  indicated by our in silico pathway analyses. Our approach represents an important
  step in understanding metabolic interactions in microbial communities through an
  integrated computational and experimental workflow.
