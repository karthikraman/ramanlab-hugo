abstract: Constructing biological networks capable of performing specific biological
  functionalities has been of sustained interest in synthetic biology. Adaptation
  is one such ubiquitous functional property, which enables every living organism
  to sense a change in its surroundings and return to its operating condition prior
  to the disturbance. In this paper, we present a generic systems theory-driven method
  for designing adaptive protein networks. First, we translate the necessary qualitative
  conditions for adaptation to mathematical constraints using the language of systems
  theory, which we then map back as ‘design requirements’ for the underlying networks.
  We go on to prove that a protein network with different input–output nodes (proteins)
  needs to be at least of third-order in order to provide adaptation. Next, we show
  that the necessary design principles obtained for a three-node network in adaptation
  consist of negative feedback or a feed-forward realization. We argue that presence
  of a particular class of negative feedback or feed-forward realization is necessary
  for a network of any size to provide adaptation. Further, we claim that the necessary
  structural conditions derived in this work are the strictest among the ones hitherto
  existed in the literature. Finally, we prove that the capability of producing adaptation
  is retained for the admissible motifs even when the output node is connected with
  a downstream system in a feedback fashion. This result explains how complex biological
  networks achieve robustness while keeping the core motifs unchanged in the context
  of a particular functionality. We corroborate our theoretical results with detailed
  and thorough numerical simulations. Overall, our results present a generic, systematic
  and robust framework for designing various kinds of biological networks.
