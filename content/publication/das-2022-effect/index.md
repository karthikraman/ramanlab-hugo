abstract: The vulnerability of networks to targeted attacks is an issue of widespread
  interest for policymakers, military strategists, network engineers and systems biologists
  alike. Current approaches to circumvent targeted attacks seek to increase the robustness
  of a network by adding or swapping edges (Edge Addition (EA) or Edge Swapping (ES)
  method respectively) that ultimately leads to a higher size of the largest connected
  component for a given fraction of nodes removed when compared to that of the original
  network. In this work, we propose a strategy in which there is a pre-existing, dormant
  spare capacity already built into the network for an identified vulnerable node,
  such that the traffic of the disrupted node can be diverted to another pre-existing
  node/set of nodes in the network. Using our algorithm, the increase in robustness
  of canonical scale-free networks was nearly 14-fold. We also analysed real-world
  networks using our algorithm, where the mean increase in robustness was nearly 5-fold.
  We have compared our work with the results obtained from other EA and ES algorithms
  and have found the increase in robustness using our algorithm to be significant
  in light of what has been reported to our knowledge in the literature. The cost
  of this spare capacity and its effect on the operational parameters of the network
  have also been discussed.
