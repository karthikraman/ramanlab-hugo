abstract: Microbial communities that metabolise pentose and hexose sugars are useful
  in producing high-value chemicals, resulting in the effective conversion of raw
  materials to the product, a reduction in the production cost, and increased yield.
  Here, we present a computational analysis approach called CAMP (Co-culture/Community
  Analyses for Metabolite Production) that simulates and identifies appropriate communities
  to produce a metabolite of interest. To demonstrate this approach, we focus on the
  optimal production of lactate from various Lactic Acid Bacteria. We used genome-scale
  metabolic models (GSMMs) belonging to Lactobacillus, Leuconostoc, and Pediococcus
  species from the Virtual Metabolic Human (VMH; https://vmh.life/) resource and well-curated
  GSMMs of L. plantarum WCSF1 and L. reuteri JCM 1112. We analysed 1176 two-species
  communities using a constraint-based modelling method for steady-state flux-balance
  analysis of communities. Flux variability analysis was used to detect the maximum
  lactate flux in the communities. Using glucose or xylose as substrates separately
  or in combination resulted in either parasitism, amensalism, or mutualism being
  the dominant interaction behaviour in the communities. Interaction behaviour between
  members of the community was deduced based on variations in the predicted growth
  rates of monocultures and co-cultures. Acetaldehyde, ethanol, acetate, among other
  metabolites, were found to be cross-fed between community members. L. plantarum
  WCSF1 was found to be a member of communities with high lactate yields. In silico
  community optimisation strategies to predict reaction knock-outs for improving lactate
  flux were implemented. Reaction knock-outs of acetate kinase, phosphate acetyltransferase,
  and fumarate reductase in the communities were found to enhance lactate production.
