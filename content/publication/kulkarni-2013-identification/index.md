abstract: ' First study reported on identification of putative allergens in chickpea
  using in silico approaches Seven novel putative allergens from chickpea (Cicer arietinum)
  have been identified, based on sequence, structural and physicochemical similarities.
  Four out of seven putative allergens may also show cross reactivity with reported
  allergens, since the potential allergens had common sequence and structural featureswith
  the reported allergens. Allergy has become a key cause of morbidity worldwide. Although
  many legumes (plants in the Fabaceae family) are healthy foods, they may have a
  number of allergenic proteins. A number of allergens have been identified and characterized
  in Fabaceae family, such as soybean and peanut, on the basis of biochemical and
  molecular biological approaches. However, our understanding of the allergens from
  chickpea (Cicer arietinum L), belonging to this family, is very limited. In this
  study, we aimed to identify putative and cross-reactive allergens from Chickpea
  (Cicer areitinum) by means of in silico analysis of the chickpea protein sequences
  and allergens sequences from Fabaceae family. We retrieved known allergen sequences
  in Fabaceae family from the IUIS Allergen Nomenclature Database. We performed a
  protein BLAST (BLASTp) on these sequences to retrieve the similar sequences from
  chickpea. We further analysed the retrieved chickpea sequences using a combination
  of in silico tools, to assess them for their allergenicity potential. Following
  this, we built structure models using FUGUE: Sequence-structure homology; these
  models generated by the recognition tool were viewed in Swiss-PDB viewer. Through
  this in silico approach, we identified seven novel putative allergens from chickpea
  proteome sequences on the basis of similarity of sequence, structure and physicochemical
  properties with the known reported legume allergens. Four out of seven putative
  allergens may also show cross reactivity with reported allergens since potential
  allergens had common sequence and structural features with the reported allergens.
  The in silico proteomic identification of the allergen proteins in chickpea provides
  a basis for future research on developing hypoallergenic foods containing chickpea.
  Such bioinformatics approaches, combined with experimental methodology, will help
  delineate an efficient and comprehensive approach to assess allergenicity and pave
  the way for a better understanding of the biological and medical basis of the same. '
