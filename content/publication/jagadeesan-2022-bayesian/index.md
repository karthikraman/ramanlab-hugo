abstract: In complex dynamical systems, precise and accurate estimation of parameters
  and quality of predictions depends on the information contained in the experimental
  data. Choosing experimental schemes that maximize information contained in the data
  is known as Optimal Experimental Design (OED). Fisher Information Matrix and variance-covariance
  matrix are the central ideas of OED. However, using OED in a class of models known
  as sloppy models renders the model less predictive, even though the parameters are
  estimated with substantial precision. This work introduces a new information gain
  index as an experiment design criterion in the Bayesian framework. The proposed
  design criterion is based on what is known as the Bhattacharyya coefficient. Our
  previous studies show that the information gain index indicates a loss of practical
  identifiability. Further, it is also an indication of sloppy and stiff parameters.
  Hence, we extend the information index and its interpretation to joint Gaussian
  distributions; then, using simulations, we demonstrate that the new experiment design
  criterion selects experiments that minimize prediction and parameter uncertainty
  in sloppy models.
