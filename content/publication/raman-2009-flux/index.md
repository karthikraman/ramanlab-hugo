abstract: Systems level modelling and simulations of biological processes are proving
  to be invaluable in obtaining a quantitative and dynamic perspective of various
  aspects of cellular function. In particular, constraint-based analyses of metabolic
  networks have gained considerable popularity for simulating cellular metabolism,
  of which flux balance analysis (FBA), is most widely used. Unlike mechanistic simulations
  that depend on accurate kinetic data, which are scarcely available, FBA is based
  on the principle of conservation of mass in a network, which utilizes the stoichiometric
  matrix and a biologically relevant objective function to identify optimal reaction
  flux distributions. FBA has been used to analyse genome-scale reconstructions of
  several organisms; it has also been used to analyse the effect of perturbations,
  such as gene deletions or drug inhibitions in silico. This article reviews the usefulness
  of FBA as a tool for gaining biological insights, advances in methodology enabling
  integration of regulatory information and thermodynamic constraints, and finally
  addresses the challenges that lie ahead. Various use scenarios and biological insights
  obtained from FBA, and applications in fields such metabolic engineering and drug
  target identification, are also discussed. Genome-scale constraint-based models
  have an immense potential for building and testing hypotheses, as well as to guide
  experimentation.
