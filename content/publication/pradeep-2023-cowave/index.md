abstract: The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has posed a significant global challenge to
  healthcare systems. Every country has seen multiple waves of this disease, placing
  a considerable strain on healthcare resources. Across the world, the pandemic has
  motivated diligent data collection, with an enormous amount of data being available
  in the public domain. In this manuscript, we collate COVID-19 case data from around
  the world (available on the World Health Organization (WHO) website), and provide
  various definitions for waves. Using these definitions to define labels, we create
  a labelled dataset, which can be used while building supervised learning classifiers.
  We also use a simple eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model to provide a minimum
  standard for future classifiers trained on this dataset and demonstrate the utility
  of our dataset for the prediction of (future) waves. This dataset will be a valuable
  resource for epidemiologists and others interested in the early prediction of future
  waves. The datasets are available from https://github.com/RamanLab/COWAVE/.
