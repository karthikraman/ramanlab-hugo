abstract: '\"This is a very comprehensive read that provides a solid base in computational
  biology. The book is structured in 4 parts and 14 chapters which cover all the way
  from the more basic concepts to advanced material, including the state-of-the-art
  methodologies in synthetic and systems biology. This is a bedside book for those
  researchers embarking to do investigation in computational biology and a great office
  companion for anyone working on systems and synthetic biology.\" -- Rodrigo Ledesma
  Amaro, Lecturer, Imperial College London  \"This is a fantastic book. It offers
  an elegant introduction to both classical and modern concepts in computational biology.
  To the uninitiated, it is a terrific first read, bringing alive the glory of the
  past and the promise of the future. To the interested, it handholds and offers a
  springboard to dive deep. To the practitioner, it serves as a valuable resource
  bringing together in a panoramic view many diverse streams that adorn the landscape.\"
  -- Narendra M. Dixit, Professor, Indian Institute of Science An Introduction to
  Computational Systems Biology: Systems-Level Modelling of Cellular Networks delivers
  a comprehensive and insightful account of applying mathematical modelling approaches
  to very large biological systems and networks≈Øle1em1pta fundamental aspect of computational
  systems biology. The book covers key modelling paradigms in detail, while at the
  same time retaining a simplicity that will appeal to those from less quantitative
  fields.  Features   A hands-on approach to modelling   Covers a broad spectrum of
  modelling, from static networks to dynamic models and constraint-based models   Thoughtful
  exercises to test and enable understanding of concepts   State-of-the-art chapters
  on exciting new developments like community modelling and biological circuit design   Emphasis
  on coding and software tools for systems biology  This book is highly multi-disciplinary
  and will appeal to biologists, engineers, computer scientists, mathematicians and
  others.'
