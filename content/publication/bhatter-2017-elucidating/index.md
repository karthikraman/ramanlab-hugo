abstract: Microbial volatile organic compounds (VOCs) have gained prominence in the
  recent past for their potential use as disease markers. The discovery of microbial
  VOCs has benefited 'difficult to detect' diseases such as tuberculosis (TB). Few
  of the identified VOCs of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) are currently being explored
  for their diagnostic potential. However, very little is known about the biosynthesis
  of these small lipophilic molecules. Here, we propose putative biosynthetic pathways
  in Mycobacterium tuberculosis for three VOCs, namely methyl nicotinate, methyl phenylacetate
  and methyl p-anisate, using computational approaches. In particular, we identify
  S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) transferases that play a crucial role in esterification
  of the acids to the final product. Our results provide important insights into the
  specificity of these pathways to Mtb species.
