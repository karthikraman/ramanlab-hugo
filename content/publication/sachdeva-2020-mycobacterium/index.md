abstract: Intracellular pathogens commonly manipulate the host lysosomal system for
  their survival. However, whether this pathogen-induced alteration affects the organization
  and functioning of the lysosomal system itself is not known. Here, using in vitro
  and in vivo infections and quantitative image analysis, we show that the lysosomal
  content and activity are globally elevated in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infected
  macrophages. We observed that this enhanced lysosomal state is sustained over time
  and defines an adaptive homeostasis in the infected macrophage. Lysosomal alterations
  are caused by mycobacterial surface components, notably the cell wall associated
  lipid sulfolipid-1 (SL-1), which functions through the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) –
  transcription factor EB (TFEB) axis in the host cells. An Mtb mutant lacking SL-1,
  MtbDpks2, shows attenuated lysosomal rewiring compared with the wild type Mtb in
  both in vitro and in vivo infections. Exposing macrophages to purified SL-1 enhanced
  the trafficking of phagocytic cargo to lysosomes. Correspondingly, MtbDpks2 exhibited
  a further reduction in lysosomal delivery compared with the wild type. Reduced trafficking
  of this mutant Mtb strain to lysosomes correlated with enhanced intracellular bacterial
  survival. Our results reveal that global alteration of the host lysosomal system
  is a defining feature of Mtb infected macrophages and suggest that this altered
  lysosomal state protects host cell integrity and contributes to the containment
  of the pathogen.
